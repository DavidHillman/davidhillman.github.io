<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I came, was given a name, and told to go forth and conquer.  After many attempts at conquering the world, I have now settled for conquering myself and my bad habits.  While I can get excited and talk a lot, I do listen if you ask me nicely.  I enjoy being around people who are outgoing, non-judgemental, and just great traveling companions.  I don't like squares because they are pointy.  Minimalism is my motto.  Bicycles are how I get around.  Let's keep things simple, stupid and organic shall we?</p>
